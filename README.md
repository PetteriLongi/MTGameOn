# MTGameOn

A simple Magic the Gathering companion app.
Made for android system using Kotlin as the language of choice.
For now it only has 1 player lifecounter system for commander gamemode with Health, commander damage, storm and poison calculators.
I plan to add more functionality such as: simplified 4 player mode on a future update.

#Version 1.0: Release.
Added features: 
continuous press on +1 and -1 buttons,
button feedback (darken button when pressed),
savedstate (when you leave the "Game on" back to main menu it remembers your remaining counters.

The app works in fullscreen and has its own "return" button but swiping on the bottom or top of the app brings out the phones own system toolbars which then fade away again.
